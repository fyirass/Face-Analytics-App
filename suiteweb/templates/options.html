                <h3>How DeepFace works?</h3>
                <p>DeepFace model begins by using aligned versions of several existing databases to improve the algorithms and produce a normalized output. However, these models are insufficient to produce effective facial recognition in all instances. DeepFace uses fiducial point detectors based on existing databases to direct the alignment of faces. The facial alignment begins with a 2D alignment and then continues with 3D alignment and frontalization.</p>
                <p>DeepFaceâ€™s process is two steps. First, it corrects the angles of an image so that the face in the photo is looking forward. To accomplish this, it uses a 3-D model of a face. Then the deep learning produces a numerical description of the face. If DeepFace comes up with a similar enough description for two images, it assumes that these two images share a face.</p>
